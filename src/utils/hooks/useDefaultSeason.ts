 * Custom hook for selecting and managing the default season for a TV series.

 * - Restoring previously selected season from sessionStorage
 * - Auto-selecting the first unwatched regular season (prioritizes regular seasons over specials)
 * - Only falls back to special seasons if no regular seasons exist
 * - Properly handles the case where some episodes in special seasons are watched
